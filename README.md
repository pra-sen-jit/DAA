This repository holds the C language codes for various algorithms out there. Each and every code is tried and tested, and is completely bug-freeüôÇ. You can find that all sorts of approaches have been used, including greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming etc.

## As of now, following algorithms are present in this repo:
`Greedy`
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Prim's algorithm

`Divide and Conquer`
- Merge Sort
- Min and Max number from an array
- Multiplying two numbers
- Quick Sort

`Dynamic Programming`
- 0-1 Knapsack
- Bellman Ford
- Factorial of a number
- nth term of Fibonacci Series
- nCr

*Feel free to check them out. More algorithms will be added soon‚ù§Ô∏è*
